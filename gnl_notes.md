QUESTIONS:

    - How big is the stack? Is 10,000,000 bytes bigger than what fits on the stack? 


FD_MAX = 4096

typedef struct s_List_of_read_fragments
{
    char   * 

}


static char    *extra_chars[FD_MAX];
    - An array of char pointers, the size of FD_MAX. Each points to a string containing the leftover chars for that FD.
